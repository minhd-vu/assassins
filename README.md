<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Assassins is a game that can be played almost anywhere, but best done in semi-crowded environments. The goal of the game is to be the last remaining person alive and to assassinate whomever you are assigned. Read more about assassins [here](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassin_(game)>).

This project is designed to easily facilitate the distribution of targets to players, along with the transfer of targets post-assassination. Additionally, assassins aims to resolve some of the complications that can arise in these processes.
